Identifying Functional and Non-Functional Requirements

As proposed in the given problem that due to increasing size and capacity of the institute,it is required to build a library management system.The library information system will be used to manage the functioning of the library.The system should generate all the information for various purposes and should be helpful to all the staff members who are putting effort in their respective working areas

1)Functional requirements for the library information system.
  A)Update the stock details-The system should enter the details of the new books and magazines available and the data should be updated regularly when the stock is taken out or when new books or magazines are added in the system.
  
  B)Technological progress-The system should be built in such a way that it is unique so that it can run smoothly in the competitive market.
  
  C)Disclosure of identity number-The system should provide unique ientity numbers 
  
  D)Reservation-One of a management system's most crucial features is the ability to allow members to reserve a specific item they want from any location by using their  membership number.
  
  E)An easy searching option-The system should provide an easy and smooth searching option for smooth and clear functioning of the library.
  
  F)Calculatation of fine-The system should take notice of the books given to the user and should calculate the fine if not return back on time.

 2)Non-Functional requirements for the library information system.
 A)Security-The access of the system should be provided to some pecified users only.Only specified persons should only be able to access the system.
 
 B)Easiness-The system should be easy to use and user friendly,

 C)Maintainability-The system should be easy to maintain means if any minor update or modification in the system should not harm the whole system.

 D)Performance-System should be able to complete the desirable task in a specific amount of time only.

 E)Reliability-The system should be reliable and show complete details with accuracy like user registration and authorization.searching of the books,maintaining books  in order etcâ€¦

 F)Scalability-One of the most important feature of the system is its scalability.The system should be scalable according to the capacity and size of users 
 
                                                                         Problem-2

Q.2. Identify scope, features and non-functional aspects of the following problem.

As proposed in the given problem-2 that due to increasing size and capacity of the institute,it is required to develop an application for deaf people that recognizes key sound events like vehicle horns and immediate alerts.Analysis of the requirements for deaf mobile applications is necessary to make sure that the needs of people with disabilities are incorporated into the mobile applications created for them.

1)Functional requirements for the Application

 a)Recognition of key sound events-The system should recognize all the key sound events happening around the user like car horn or any other sound.

 b)Low-Latency-The application should be developed with low latency and can be accessible easily to android users

c)Mobile applications developed must
be able to ensure prospect of a user, along with the limitation in
mobile technology.


d)Technological progress-The application should be built in such a way that it is unique so that it can run smoothly in the competitive market.


e)An easy to use application-aplication should be developed n such a way that it can also be used easily by people who has a little knowledge of the phone.

f)Low power consumption-the app should be developed in such a way that the power consumption in the phone should be minimum.


2)Non-Functional requirements for the mobile application.

 a)obtaining the software development specification.

 b)Easiness-The system should be easy to use and user friendly,

 c)Assembling-assembling the development equipment.

 d)Technical requirements-for the work environment defining the  security criteria.

 e)Performance-Application should be able to complete the desirable task in a specific amount of time only.

 f)Maintainability-The system should be easy to maintain means if any minor update or modification in the system should not harm the whole system.
